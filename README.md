ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Seohyeon Lee. I'm a junior at Pomona College studying CS and Math.

ðŸ‘€ I'm attracted to CS because it helps me bring my ideas into reality. I'm building on my public policy experience to explore the intersection of tech and human rights. For instance, my project Connecting Communities is an interactive map where users can locate resources like free mentstrual products and clean public bathrooms. My team was awarded Best Hack that Serves the Community in the MLH All In Hackathon for this project. 

ðŸŒ± I work on ML projects at P-ai (AI club of the Claremont Colleges). I'm also a graduate of All In Open Source run by GitHub, where I took GitHub courses and learned about the basics of open source. 

Relevant Classes:

Computer Science: Data Structures & Advanced Programming (Java), Discrete Math & Functional Programming (TA Spring '23), Neural Networks

Math: Probability, Combinatorics, Linear Algebra (TA Fall '22), Multivariable Calculus, Statistical Theory
