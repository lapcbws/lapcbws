ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Seohyeon Lee. I'm a sophomore at Pomona College studying CS and Math while exploring wide interests.

ðŸ‘€ I'm attracted to CS because it takes my imagination far away. 
I'm part of Github All In, a mentoring program for under-represented tech students that provides training for open-source projects and professional development.
I'm also part of P-ai, the AI club of the Claremont Colleges. 

ðŸŒ± I took Discrete Math and Functional Programming, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Combinatorics.
I'm taking Data Structures & Algorithms (Java) and Probability.
