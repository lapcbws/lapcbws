ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Seohyeon Lee. I'm a sophomore at Pomona College studying CS and Math while exploring wide interests.

ðŸ‘€ I'm attracted to CS because it helps me bring my ideas into reality. I'm building on my public policy experience to explore the intersection of tech and human rights. 

ðŸŒ± I'm taking Data Structures & Algorithms (Java) and Probability. I took Discrete Math and Functional Programming (currently a TA), Linear Algebra (TAed for Fall 2022), Multivariable Calculus, and Combinatorics. I work on ML projects at P-ai (AI incubator run by Claremont Colleges students). Outside of school, I'm learning about Open Source through GitHub All In, where I take GitHub courses and connect with under-represented tech students from all over the US.
