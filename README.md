ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Seohyeon Lee. I'm a sophomore at Pomona College studying CS and Math while exploring wide interests.

ðŸ‘€ I'm attracted to CS because it's an empowering tool that helps me realize my ideas. 
I'm part of Github All In, a mentoring program for under-represented tech students that provides training for open-source projects and professional development.

ðŸŒ± I took Discrete Math and Functional Programming, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Combinatorics so far. 
I will take Data Structures and Algorithms this spring. I'm learning Javascript and SQL during winter break.
